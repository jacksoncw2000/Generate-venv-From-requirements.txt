# Create-venv-From-requirements.txt

Creates a virtual environment in the same directory as a requirements.txt file.

To use the create_venv.py script:
* Move the create_venv.py file somewhere such as your ~/utilities path.
* Confirm that the ~/utilities folder or whatever path chosen is in your PATH. Adding the folder that contains create_venv.py to PATH is required to be able to execute the create_venv.py script from anywhere in Terminal.
* Then make the command executable in Terminal with:
*    chmod +x ~/utilities/create_venv.py
* If not using the ~/utilities folder, change ~/utilities to your create_venv.py folder path.
* Then you will be able to execute create_venv.py from any directory without specifying the full path to the create_venv.py file.
